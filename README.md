# The_Flow_Shop_Scheduling_Problem
Solving the Flow Shop Scheduling Problem using Genetic Algorithms 

In this homework, you are going to solve the flow shop scheduling problem for three data sets given in the text file called “fssp-data-3instances.txt”. The number jobs and machines are different in these data sets. The objective function is to minimize the makespan, i.e., the completion of the last job processed by the last machine. <br>

I would like to remind you the following points which you should consider when you submit your homework. It will consists of two parts: your code and report. First, your code must be clear and you should define the following using comment lines in the code: variables names and their purpose, function names and their purpose. For example, you should write “X is the assignment variable”, “CompObj calculates the objective value”, etc. Or, you can use a function name that is self explanatory e.g., ApplyMove.
